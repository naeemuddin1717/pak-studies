# Creation of Pakistan (1947)

Pakistan was created on 14 August 1947 after years of political struggle led by Muslim leaders. The Lahore Resolution of 1940 provided the formal demand for a separate homeland. After WWII weakened the British Empire, negotiations accelerated. The persistent efforts of the Muslim League and the leadership of Quaid-e-Azam resulted in the division of the subcontinent and the birth of Pakistan.
