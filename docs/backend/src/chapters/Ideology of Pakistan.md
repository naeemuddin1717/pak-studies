# Ideology of Pakistan

The ideology of Pakistan is based on the belief that Muslims of the subcontinent are a separate nation with their own cultural, religious, and social identity. It emphasizes living life according to Islamic principles, ensuring social justice, equality, and protection of minority rights. The ideology later became the foundation for demanding a separate homeland for Muslims.
