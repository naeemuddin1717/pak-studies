# Two Nation Theory

The Two Nation Theory states that Muslims and Hindus in the Indian subcontinent were two distinct nations with different religions, cultures, traditions, and social systems. Due to these differences, Muslims needed a separate homeland where they could live according to their own values. This theory became the basis for the creation of Pakistan in 1947.
