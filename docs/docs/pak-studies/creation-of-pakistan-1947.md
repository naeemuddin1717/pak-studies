title: Creation of Pakistan (1947)
---

Pakistan was created on 14 August 1947 after a long political and ideological struggle. The Lahore Resolution of 1940 provided the formal demand for a separate country. After World War II, the British decided to leave the subcontinent. Muslim League's strong stance and Quaid-e-Azam’s leadership forced the British and Congress to accept Pakistan as an independent state. Thus, Pakistan emerged as a new country in 1947.
