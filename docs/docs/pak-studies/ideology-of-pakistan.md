title: Ideology of Pakistan
---

The ideology of Pakistan is based on the idea that Muslims of the subcontinent are a separate nation. Their religion, culture, traditions, and values are different from Hindus. This belief gave Muslims the right to have a separate homeland where they could live according to Islamic principles, with justice, equality, and protection of rights. The ideology later became the foundation of the Pakistan Movement.
