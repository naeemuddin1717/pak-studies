title: Quaid-e-Azam’s Role
---

Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah played the most critical role in the creation of Pakistan. Through his leadership, intelligence, strong arguments, and negotiations, he united Muslims on one platform. He presented Muslim demands clearly to the British and resisted Congress dominance. His determination and vision guided the Muslims through the Pakistan Movement, eventually achieving a separate homeland.
