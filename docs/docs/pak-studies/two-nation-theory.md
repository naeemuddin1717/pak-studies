title: Two Nation Theory
---

The Two Nation Theory explains that Muslims and Hindus in the subcontinent were two different nations. They had separate religions, cultures, ways of life, and social systems. Due to these differences, Muslims feared domination under a Hindu majority. This theory strengthened the demand for a separate homeland and became the main reason behind the creation of Pakistan in 1947.
