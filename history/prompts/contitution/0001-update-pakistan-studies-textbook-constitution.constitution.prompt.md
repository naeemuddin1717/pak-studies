Update the project constitution to reflect the core principles and guidelines for a textbook project on "Pakistan Studies". The constitution should emphasize:

1.  **Historical Accuracy & Context**: Stress the importance of factual, balanced reporting of historical events, including diverse perspectives on the Pakistan Movement.
2.  **Ideological Clarity**: Clearly articulate the Ideology of Pakistan (Two-Nation Theory, vision of Allama Iqbal and Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah) and its continuous relevance.
3.  **Geo-Political and Socio-Economic Analysis**: Focus on Pakistan's geography, its diverse cultures, economy, social structure, and strategic regional/global relations (Foreign Policy).
4.  **Promoting Responsible Citizenship**: Highlight constitutional development, democratic values, human rights, and the role of citizens in national progress.
5.  **Cultural and Civilizational Heritage**: Include the Indus Valley Civilization, the impact of Islamic civilization on the subcontinent, and the rich, diverse cultural tapestry of Pakistan.

Also, add sections for "Academic Standards" (leveraging primary/secondary sources, academic rigor) and "Research & Writing Workflow" (iterative, peer review, knowledge transfer). The governance section should reflect these new principles.

## Response snapshot
