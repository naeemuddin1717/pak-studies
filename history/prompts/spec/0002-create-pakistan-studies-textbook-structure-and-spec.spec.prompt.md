Create the complete empty folder and file structure for the Pakistan Studies textbook project. Do NOT write any chapter content yet — only create all the required files and folders with proper names and paths. Use the standard Docusaurus + Spec-Kit Plus structure that works perfectly with GitHub Pages deployment.

**Requirements:**
- Root folder name: `pak-studies-textbook`
- Use Docusaurus v3 structure
- Include all necessary config files for immediate GitHub Pages deploy
- Add separate folders for `specs`, `chapters`, `assets`, `RAG backend`
- Add placeholder files for bonus features (`auth`, `personalization`, `Urdu translation`)
- Add `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and deployment workflow

Create every single file and folder (even if empty) in one go using your file creation capability. After creating the structure, show me the full tree so I can verify before we start filling content.

## Response snapshot
The folder and file structure for the "Pakistan Studies" textbook project has been created successfully, and the feature specification (spec.md) has been generated and validated. All checklist items passed.

## Outcome
- ✅ Impact: Project structure and spec created.
- 🧪 Tests: Spec validated against checklist (all pass).
